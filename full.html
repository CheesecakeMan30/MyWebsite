            <li>Snowhere You're Going - App</li>
            <p>The app, "Snowhere You're Going," is designed to enhance the skiing experience by allowing users to track their skiing hours, search for resorts, and review their visits, all while fostering competition and planning ski trips with friends. It integrates weather data for added convenience and supports user personalization, including features like dark mode. The appâ€™s core functionalities focus on resort searchability and a ski logging system to record user activity. Built with a user-friendly layout, it utilizes Azure SQL for database management and web functionality through virtual machines. Future enhancements aim to include detailed weather data, advanced user authentication, social features, and scalability for handling larger datasets.</p>

            <li>My Portfolio (This Website)</li>
            <p>This website is a showcase of my programming projects, showcasing my ability to create dynamic webpages, implement responsive design, and collaborate with others on projects. The website uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a clean and user-friendly interface, and integrates various API calls to fetch data and display it in a visually appealing manner. The website also includes a slider component using CSS variables and a JavaScript function to automatically transition images.</p>

            <li>Career Compass App (Sydney Dews and Chad Wangolo) - In Progress</li>
            <p>The application is a subscription-based platform designed to support individuals as they transition out of rehabilitation programs and back into society. It focuses on providing tools and resources to help users secure employment and build professional networks. The app will guide users through updating their resumes, finding references, taking professional headshots, and creating LinkedIn profiles to establish their professional presence. It will include templates for messaging employers, posting accomplishments, and tracking job applications through a spreadsheet system. To foster accountability and encouragement, users can pair up with fellow rehab graduates through a buddy system. The app will also offer virtual job counseling sessions and include a donation feature where the public can contribute professional clothing or funds to help participants dress for success. Rehabs will fund the first year of access for users, with an option to continue for a small monthly fee. Ultimately, the goal is to help individuals secure quality jobs, avoid relapse, and potentially give back by supporting other users or working part-time for the app.</p>

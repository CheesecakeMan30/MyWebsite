        <p align = "center">Hello, my name is Chad Wangolo, and I am currently pursuing a Bachelorâ€™s degree in Computer Science at West Virginia University. My academic journey has fostered a deep interest in software development, data analytics, artificial intelligence, and full stack development, and I am eager to apply my skills in these fields after graduation.
            Upon completing my degree, I aspire to learn and contribute to building secure systems, developing and building on cutting-edge technology, and contributing to the growth of our economy [helping with the data analytics aspect]. I am committed to leveraging my education and experiences to make a meaningful impact in the ever-evolving world of technology.
            Beyond academics, I enjoy playing basketball and football with my friends, drawing, playing the piano, doing theatre, and working out. These activities not only enrich my personal life but also inspire creativity and problem-solving in my professional endeavors.
            Thank you for visiting my page, and I invite you to connect with me to learn more about my work, aspirations, or potential collaboration opportunities.

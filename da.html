        <h3>Microsoft Excel Projects</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>AB Testing</li>
            <p>For this excel project I focused on analyzing the impact of different marketing strategies or interventions. The workbook includes multiple sheets: an "Overview" introducing the project, a "Data Dictionary" explaining the dataset's structure and variables, a "Complete Your Analysis!" sheet containing raw data for analysis, a "PivotTable" sheet summarizing key metrics, and a "Solutions" sheet with answers or insights derived from the analysis. The project involved cleaning and exploring the dataset, creating pivot tables to compare group performance, and deriving actionable insights from the results. The analysis aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of marketing strategies or determine significant differences between the test and control groups.</p>

            <li>Youtube Trending Videos</li>
            <p>For this excel project I focused on identifying patterns and insights within the dataset. The file includes multiple sheets that may contain an overview of the project, a data dictionary describing the variables, raw data for analysis, and potentially visualizations or summaries of key findings. The analysis involved exploring metrics such as video views, likes, comments, and categories to understand trends, audience engagement, or content performance. Insights were derived to determine factors contributing to a video's success, patterns in trending content, or comparisons across different categories or regions.</p>

            <li>Grammy's Project</li>
            <p>For this excel project I focused on the Grammy Awards. The project includes datasets related to Grammy nominees, winners, categories, and other relevant metrics. The analysis involved organizing and cleaning the data, creating visualizations or pivot tables to highlight trends, and identifying patterns such as genre dominance, recurring winners, or changes in category focus over time. The project aimed to provide insights into the characteristics of Grammy recognition, such as artist demographics, song or album attributes, and shifts in industry trends.</p>
        </ul>

        <h3>Tableau Projects</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Super Bowl Analysis</li>
            <p>For this project I examined datasets encompassing Super Bowl scores, television ratings, and halftime shows to address various analytical questions. The tasks involved merging these datasets to facilitate comprehensive analysis. Participants created a calculated field to determine the year of each Super Bowl game and visualized average household ratings over time using line charts to identify viewership patterns. To assess game competitiveness, they developed calculated fields to extract winning and losing team scores, compute score differences, and categorize games into "Nail-Biter," "Close Game," "Easy Win," or "Blowout." This categorization was then visualized through bar charts to determine the most common game types. Additionally, participants analyzed advertising trends by plotting average advertising costs over the years and examining the relationship between ad costs and household ratings. An optional "LevelUp" task involved creating a horizontal bar chart to showcase average U.S. viewership by halftime show headliners, filtered to include only main performers and colored by game result type, to identify the most popular acts and the nature of games during their performances.</p>

            <li>Creating Visualizations</li>
            <p>For this project I dealt with three datasets: adult heights by country, music sales from 1973 to 2019, and global video game sales. The tasks included creating world maps to compare average male and female heights against global averages, identifying geographical patterns, and highlighting specific countries with notable height disparities between genders. Additionally, participants developed line and stacked bar charts to analyze total music sales over time, distinguishing between formats such as Cassette, CD, Download, LP/EP, and Paid Subscriptions, and identifying dominant formats in specific years. The final task involved constructing a sorted bar chart to determine the top three video game genres by total global sales, aiding a new company's market entry strategy. An optional "LevelUp" challenge encouraged creating a choropleth map to visualize countries with average female heights relative to the world average using raw data.</p>
            
            <li>Forbes Highest Paid Celebrities</li>
            <p>For this project I analyzed a Forbes dataset detailing top celebrities and their earnings from 2005 to 2020, with a focus on gender-based pay disparities. The analysis involved creating a series of visualizations to explore the data, including a side-by-side bar chart comparing total earnings by gender for actors and actresses from 2016 to 2020 to highlight pay gaps. A bar chart was developed to compare average compensations between male and female actors, while a horizontal bar chart identified the highest-paid actors and actresses, analyzing the gender distribution among top earners. Additionally, a line chart was constructed to observe trends in average earnings over the years, assessing whether the gender pay gap has widened or narrowed over time.</p>
